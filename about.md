# About PhD Advice Hub

This hub is a community-driven project connecting prospective Greek MSc and PhD students with compatriots already studying abroad. It's still a work in progress, but our goal is to create a comprehensive directory where students can find peers in their field, seek guidance, and share insights about the postgraduate journey.

## Mission

Our mission is to:
- Connect Greek MSc and PhD students across disciplines and institutions
- Provide a platform for sharing advice, experiences, and resources
- Foster a supportive academic community within the Greek diaspora
- Help prospective students make informed decisions about studying abroad

## How to Add Your Profile

This is an open-source project hosted on GitHub. We welcome profiles from:
- Current MSc and PhD students studying abroad
