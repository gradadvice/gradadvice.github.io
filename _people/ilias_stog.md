## Bio

My name is Ilias (pronounced "ee-lee-ahs" or "ee-ly-ahs"), and I'm a second-year PhD student at The University of Edinburgh. I'm part of the Vios Science Lab under the guidance of Prof. Sotirios Tsaftaris and Dr. Steven McDonagh.

Before embarking on my PhD, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), supervised by Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos. I also worked as an Applied Machine Learning Researcher at helvia.ai, specialising in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

I'm an active member of the NLP Group at AUEB, where we conduct research in NLP and Machine Learning.
